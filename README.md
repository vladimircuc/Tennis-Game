## About The Project

Embarking on this humble project in my senior year of high school, I present a simple yet engaging tennis game that offers players the opportunity to enjoy a quick and entertaining gaming experience. Upon launching the game, players are greeted with the option to either play or gracefully exit.

Choosing to play, users then have the chance to select their tennis player from a list of options. Once a player is chosen, a click on the "start" button initiates the game, where users take control of the selected tennis player's racket. The player will gain points the more he can keep the ball within the racket and the wall      

Upon the conclusion of the game, players are presented with their final score. At this point, a thoughtful user interface prompts players to decide whether they wish to embark on another round by pressing the SPACE key or gracefully exit the game by hitting ESC.

This project, born from a culmination of my passion for programming and gaming, encapsulates the essence of simplicity and enjoyment. The game provides a straightforward yet engaging tennis experience, offering players the choice to continue refining their skills or gracefully conclude their gaming session. As a student in my senior year of high school, this project reflects my dedication to combining creativity and technical proficiency in crafting an accessible and enjoyable gaming endeavor.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installation

The game has a few issues that I didn't manage to fix yet so I will write a few things you need to do before playing      
1. Download the Tennis Game folder    
2. After you download the game, first go to folder "Atestat", then open the "Form1.cs" in any editor
3. Follow the insctructions written in commants to change the location of the rackets images
4. After changing the paths as needed run the program and ignore the pop-up issue "There were build issues". Just click "Yes" and play the game

### Running

The instructions are explained in the description phase. Moreover, the game indications are really straightforward one the game begins

## Evaluation


In its current state, the implementation of the tennis game project is a work in progress. While the basic functionalities such as player selection and game initiation work well, there are existing bugs that need attention.     

Rigorous testing is ongoing, and the project remains open to improvements. Some features are yet to be implemented, and if given more time, I would focus on debugging to enhance stability. Additionally, improvements in user interface design and addressing the existing bugs would be a priority.    

If I were to approach the project differently, a more meticulous testing phase would have been beneficial to catch and resolve issues earlier in the development process.
