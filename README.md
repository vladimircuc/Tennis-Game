# Tennis-Game 
Welcome to my Tennis game!   
This was a project I created in my senior year of high-school as my final project    
Therefore it has a few issues :)) and I didn't manage to dix them so I will write a few things you need to do before playing      
1. After you download the game, first go to folder "Atestat", then open the "Form1.cs" in any editor
2. Follow the insctructions written in commants to change the location of the rackets images
3. After changing the paths as needed run the program and ignore the pop-up issue "There were build issues". Just click "Yes" and play the game
   
After you start the game you have the chance to play or exit. If you choose to play you will need to select your player
After selecting your tennis player you can click start and the game will begin. You will play with the racket of the tennis player you chose
There are few bugs in the game but I was only 17 when I created it so please don't rage at me, I did my best :))
After you lose you will see your score and be able to choose if you want to play again -> press SPACE
or exit pressing ESC.
HAVE FUN !
